# ARinteractive3Dmodel

In this paper we define interactive Augmented Reality (AR) as the ability to display, interact and control of the
virtual 3D model in the real environment. We also define 3D components as the pieces which form the whole 3D model.
Interactive AR involves the interaction between two entities, i.e. input device and the displayed virtual model. Our emphasis is
placed on the displayed virtual model, in which its components can be moved and controlled individually. Our AR application contains 3 main processing units, i.e. OBJ file parser, rendering
machine, and display & interactive unit. The file parser is the most important unit in our application, used to segregate each component of the 3D model from the input OBJ graphics file
into different containers. The segregation is the key process to make the interaction with the 3D model at component level feasible. Rendering machine performs the transformations of
the individual 3D components based on the information stored in the component containers and the input value received from
the display & interactive unit. The display & interactive unit displays the virtual 3D model in the real environment and
capture the input instructions given by the users.
